Welcome to the audio tutorial.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this section, we will discuss HTML5 features.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Feel free to ask questions at any time.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's dive into the details of audio and video elements.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
HTML5 introduces new semantic elements.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
These elements help structure your web pages better.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For example, the <article> and <section> tags.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, let's look at the <audio> element.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The <audio> element allows you to embed sound content.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can control playback using JavaScript.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Next, we will explore the <video> element.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The <video> element works similarly to the <audio> element.

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It allows you to embed video content.

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can also control video playback using JavaScript.

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's move on to some advanced features.

16
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
HTML5 supports offline web applications.

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is achieved using the Application Cache.

18
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You can specify resources to cache in a manifest file.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This allows your web app to work without an internet connection.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
